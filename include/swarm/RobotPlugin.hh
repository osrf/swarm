  ///
  /// * Configuration.
  ///     - Load()    This method will allow the agent to read SDF parameters
  ///                 from the model.
  ///
  /// * Communication.
  ///     - Bind()      This method binds an address to a virtual socket, and
  ///                   sends incoming messages to the specified callback.
  ///     - SendTo()    This method allows an agent to send data to other
  ///                   individual agent (unicast), all the agents (broadcast),
  ///                   or a group of agents (multicast).
  ///     - Host()      This method will return the agent's address.
  ///     - Neighbors() This method returns the addresses of other vehicles that
  ///                   are inside the communication range of this robot.
  ///
  ///  * Motion.
  ///     - Type()               This method returns the type of vehicle where
  ///                            this controller is running.
  ///     - SetLinearVelocity()  New linear velocity applied to the robot.
  ///     - SetAngularVelocity() New angular velocity applied to the robot.
  ///     - Dock() Dock a rotor vehicle to a ground vehicle.
  ///     - IsDocked() Return true if the rotor vehicle is docked.
  ///     - Launch() Launch a rotor vehicle from a ground vehicle.
  ///
  ///  * Sensors and world information.
  ///     - Pose() Get the robot's current pose from its GPS sensor.
  ///     - Height() Get the height above ground level.
  ///     - SearchArea() Get the search area, in GPS coordinates.
  ///     - MapQuery() Query the map for height and terrain type info.
  ///     - Image() Get the list of detected objects, and other related
  ///       information, from the camera sensor.
  ///     - CameraToWorld() Convert a pose in a robot's camera frame
  ///       into the world frame.
  ///     - Imu() Get the robot's linear and angular velocities and position
  ///       relative to a reference position (starting pose).
  ///     - Bearing() Get the angle between the true North and the robot.
  ///     - SetCameraOrientation() Set the pan(yaw)/tilt(pitch) of
  ///       the camera.
  ///     - CameraOrientation() Get the pan(yaw)/tilt(pitch) of the camera.
  ///     - Terrain() Get the terrain type at this vehicle's location.
  ///     - LostPersonDir() Get the direction from the BOO to the lost person.
  ///
  ///  * Battery
  ///     Each vehicle begins with a starting battery capacity. This
  ///     capacity lowers as time progresses. A vehicle may recharge its
  ///     battery by stopping (zero velocity) within 100 meters of the
  ///     base of operations (BOO). A battery recharges four times faster
  ///     than it discharges.
  ///
  ///     - BatteryStartCapacity() Starting battery capacity (mAh).
  ///     - BatteryCapacity() Current battery capacity (mAh).
  ///     - BatteryConsumption() Battery consumption (mA).
  ///     - BatteryConsumptionFactor() Factor applied to battery consumption
  ///                                  to account for additional loss.
  ///     - ExpectedBatteryLife() Battery life in seconds, based on the
  ///                             current capacity and consumption.
  ///
  ///  * Introspection.
  ///     - BooPose() Get the latitude and longitude of the BOO.
  ///     - Type() Get the vehicle type.
  ///     - Name() Get the name of the vehicle.
  ///     - SearchArea() Get the GPS coordinates of the search area.
