  /// \brief A logger is an object that stores a list of loggable clients.
  /// In each Update(), the logger collects the log information from each client
  /// and saves it into disk. We use a protobuf variable as the exchange unit
  /// between the log clients and the logger (see msgs/log_entry.proto).
  /// A "msgs::LogEntry" message contains the simulation time, the ID of the
  /// robot and all the information that we want to log for the given robot at
  /// this specific simulation time.
  /// E.g.: We want to log all the observed sensor measurements, the battery
  /// capacity, the actions sent to the robot and the messages sent/received.
  /// A client partially fills a LogEntry and the rest of the fields
  /// will be filled by other clients or the logger itself.
  /// E.g.: A "RobotPlugin" client can fill its sensor observations and the
  /// actions sent to a robot but doesn't have enough information to fill
  /// the communication information. The "BrokerPlugin" will fill that part of
  /// the LogEntry.
  ///
  /// Once the LogEntry is ready, the logger serialize the data and stores it
  /// into disk. The format of the log in disk is:
  /// <size0><log_entry0><size1><log_entry1>...<sizeN><log_entry>.

  /// Each time a log is saved into disk, it's stored under
  /// ~/.swarm/logs/<timstamp>/swarm.log
